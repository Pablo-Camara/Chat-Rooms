## About "Chat Rooms" (this web app)

I'm creating this project mainly as portfolio and as a way of exploring certain technologies and refreshing my mind with some content for later use in a professional environment.

I have created an MVP / Prototype / whatever you call it, in Sketch,
and I have created the views below that I will be implementing:

- Login
- Register
- Main menu
- List of chat rooms
- Chat room
- List of users
- Users profile page | My User profile / account page

Inside those views I have different components with different states that will make up the views.

## Tech stack

- Laravel 10
- React
- composer package "beyondcode/laravel-websockets" for server side websockets
- npm package "laravel-echo" for client side of websockets
