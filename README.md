## About "Chat Rooms" (this web app)

I'm creating this project mainly as portfolio and as a way of exploring certain technologies and refreshing my mind with some content for later use in a professional environment.

I have created an MVP / Prototype / whatever you call it, in Sketch,
and I have created the views below that I will be implementing:

- Login
    - 
![Login initial view](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/login.png)
- Register
    -  
![Register initial view](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/register.png)
- Main menu
    - 
![Register initial view](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/main-menu-no-friends.png)

![Chat room 1](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/chat-room-1.png)
![Chat room 2](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/chat-room-2.png)
- List of users
    - 
![List of users](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/list-of-users.png)
- Users profile page | My User profile / account page
    - 
![User profile not friend](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/user-profile-not-friend.png)
![User profile friend](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/user-profile-friend.png)
![User my account / profile ](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/my-account-profile.png)
![User my account / profile - edit first/last name](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/my-account-profile-edit-first-last-name.png)
![User my account / profile - change user name](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/my-account-profile-change-username.png)
![User my account / profile - change password](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/my-account-change-password.png)
![User my account / profile - edit about me](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/my-account-profile-edit-about-me.png)
![User my account / profile - edit my links](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/my-account-profile-edit-my-links.png)
![User my account / profile - add /edit link](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/my-account-profile-add-edit-link.png)


Inside those views I have different components with different states that will make up the views.
