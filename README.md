## About "Chat Rooms" (this web app)

I'm creating this project mainly as portfolio and as a way of exploring certain technologies and refreshing my mind with some content for later use in a professional environment.

I have created an MVP / Prototype / whatever you call it, in Sketch,
and I have created the views below that I will be implementing:

- Login
    - 
![Login initial view](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/login.png)
- Register
    -  
![Register initial view](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/register.png)
- Main menu
    - 
![Register initial view](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/main-menu-no-friends.png)
![Register initial view](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/main-menu-with-friends.png)
- List of chat rooms
    - 
![List of chat rooms first half](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/list-of-chat-rooms-1.png)
![List of chat rooms second half](public/MVP_DESIGN_INITIAL_IDEIA/list-of-chat-rooms-2.png)
- Chat room
- List of users
- Users profile page | My User profile / account page

Inside those views I have different components with different states that will make up the views.
